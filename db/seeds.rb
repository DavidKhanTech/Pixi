# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create([{username: DaTest}, {password: }])

# @admin = User.create!(username: 'David', email: 'coolguy@wow.com', password: '012345')
# p "Users created: #{User.count}"
